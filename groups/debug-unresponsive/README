                         debug-unresponsive
                         ==================

debug-unresponsive provides support for enabling the collection of stacks
and binder transactions when ANR/UIWDT events occur. The collection feature
is implemented in AOSP so that the collected logs are taken as close as
possible to the time of occurrence.
Additionally, the group increases the size of the stored dropbox files when
one of the above events occurs so that the newly collected data could be saved.

Properties defined:
- vendor.sys.dropbox.max_size_kb
integer value indicating the targeted size in kB of dropbox files before
truncating their content

- vendor.sys.dump.binder_stats.uiwdt
value of 1 indicates that binder statistics will be taken in case of a UIWDT

- vendor.sys.dump.binder_stats.anr
value of 1 indicates that binder statistics will be taken in case of a ANR
