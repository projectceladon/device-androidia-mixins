# The following command is duplicated on purpose:
#
# - we allow this command to fail on a userdebug or eng build to cover
#   engineering and automation needs.  Anyway, the content of the
#   bootloader policy based on the testkeys directory is not supposed
#   to change very often.
#
# - this command MUST not fail on a user build which is the "factory"
#   build.  If the device has been previously flashed with values
#   signed with a wrong odm key the previous values must be erased
#   first and then the build should flash successfully.  Have a look
#   at device/intel/build/testkeys/README for more information.
